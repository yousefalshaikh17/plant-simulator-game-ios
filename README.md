# Plant Simulator Game for iOS
⚠️ Warning: This project is no longer being maintained due to no longer having access to a MacOS device.
### Overview

The Plant Simulator game was originally created as an [Android project](https://github.com/yousefalshaikh17/plant-simulator-game-android) and later ported to iOS using Swift. The iOS version incorporates platform-specific features to enhance the user experience. It utilizes on-board accelerometers and follows Object-Oriented principles along with several Design Patterns to provide a clean and efficient architecture. The gameplay challenges the player to manage three plants by watering them appropriately, ensuring they do not dry out or drown. The game also features performance-based comments, offering feedback based on how well the player is managing the plants.

### Development & Features

This game was developed for iOS using Swift and SpriteKit. Key milestones included:

- Applied best practices for mobile development on iOS.
- Made use of the iOS feature set, including gestures to control gameplay, such as adjusting the amount of water poured.
- Integrated the accelerometer to enhance user interaction by detecting motion.
- Followed Object-Oriented principles and used multiple Design Patterns to maintain a clean, scalable codebase.

### Real-World Applications

While this project may appear to purely involve game development, it also heavily involved using Xcode to create and link scenes and UI elements. This project allowed me to demonstrate skills in iOS development with particular attention to platform-specific user interactions like gestures. It also served as an opportunity to integrate accelerometer functionality and optimize gameplay for a more immersive experience.

### Challenges & Learnings

This project had multiple challenges. The biggest challenge was implementing the game while making sure that it ran at stable framerates. This was solved through the use of dynamic programming techniques. Other challenges included trouble with tuning the accelerometer support, which was resolved through implementation of weights and minimum & maximum values from the sensor.

### Other Platforms
The game was originally made for android. Repository for this game can be found [here](https://github.com/yousefalshaikh17/plant-simulator-game-android).
